El término se volvió común en el siglo 16, cuando se usaba para referirse a grupos de todo tipo, incluyendo aquellos caracterizados por relaciones de parentesco cercanas. Para el siglo 17, empezó a referirse a rasgos físicos (fenotípicos) y luego a afiliaciones nacionales. La ciencia moderna ve la raza como una construcción social, una identidad asignada según reglas creadas por la sociedad. Aunque se basa parcialmente en similitudes físicas dentro de grupos, la raza no tiene un significado físico o biológico inherente. El concepto de raza es fundamental para el racismo, la creencia de que los humanos pueden dividirse en base a la superioridad de una raza sobre otra.\"\n\n### Notes:\n- I've tried to maintain the informal tone by using \"cualidades físicas o sociales compartidas\" instead of \"shared physical or social qualities\" to make it sound more conversational.\n- I've kept the technical terms like \"fenotípicos\" to maintain the academic tone.\n- I've used \"considerados distintos\" to convey the idea of groups being viewed as distinct within a given society.\n- I've translated \"social construct\" as \"construcción social\" to maintain the technical term.\n- I've kept the mention of racism and its connection to the concept of race to maintain the intensity and controversial nature of the original sentence.\n- I've used \"asignada según reglas creadas por la sociedad\" to convey the idea that race is an identity assigned by society, which is a key point in the original sentence.\n- I've kept the phrase \"no tiene un significado físico o biológico inherente\" to maintain the idea that race is not a biological fact.\n- Finally, I've translated \"racism\" as \"racismo\" and kept the explanation of it as \"la creencia de que los humanos pueden dividirse en base a la superioridad de una raza sobre otra\" to maintain the emotional intensity and the controversial nature of the original sentence. \n\nThis translation aims to preserve the informal, rude, and expressive tone of the original sentence while maintaining its technical and academic content.",

Modern science regards race as a social construct, an identity which is assigned based on rules made by society.[3][4] While partly based on physical similarities within groups, race does not have an inherent physical or biological meaning.[1][5][6] The concept of race is foundational to racism, the belief that humans can be divided based on the superiority of one race over another."

The phrase \"súper bienvenida\" is a common way to express \"extra welcome\" in Spanish, and \"¡hay mucho cariño en eso!\" is a natural way to say \"there's a lot of love packed into it!\" in Spanish.

The translation also preserves the somewhat rude or direct tone of the original sentence. \n\nNote: The translation is in a neutral Spanish, but if you want to make it more colloquial or slang-heavy, you could use \"acróstico\" instead of \"acrónimo\" and \"que armamos\" instead of \"que inventamos\", but this would depend on the specific context and the slang used in the group. \n\nHowever, based on the given guidelines, the translation provided above should be suitable.",

        "original_content": "I have a new neighbor: Maria Alejandro, a 43-year-old woman of South American descent, lives in the artistic heart of San Francisco. As a dedicated child psychologist, she works tirelessly to help underprivileged children and adolescents navigate through the maze of their mental health struggles. She is of average build but possesses an air of quiet strength about her, with her shoulder-length raven-black hair framing her face, bringing out her deep-set dark brown eyes and olive skin. Maria’s sense of style is multicultural, encompassing colorful flowery blouses and hand-stitched, patterned skirts, coupled with a sentimental relic in the form of her late mother’s turquoise pendant which she always wears as a comforting reminder. In her spare time, she immerses herself in writing; putting together short stories inspired by the rich tapestry of her professional encounters, aiming to provide educational tools for parents in understanding their children better. Bilingual since childhood, her vivacious conversations are often sprinkled with diverse languages, especially when she gets excited. Maria lives alone with her two adopted stray cats, Texas and Tango, and her world revolves around creating a safe space for her patients, her writing, and her beloved feline family."

The use of \"Maravilloso\" and \"Encantadoramente\" to translate \"Wonderful\" and \"Charmingly\" keeps the flattering, exaggerated tone.

The use of \"un montón\" to translate \"a lot\" maintains the casual and expressive nature of the original. The phrase \"súper bienvenida\" is used to convey the same level of welcome and affection as \"extra welcome\".

The use of \"¿podrías?\" (could you) is a polite way to make a request in Spanish, but the context and the mention of the person's phobia still convey a slightly condescending tone. The slang or informal expressions used in the original sentence are not directly translatable to Spanish, so the translation focuses on maintaining the tone and implied meaning rather than direct word-for-word translation. \n\nNote: The phrase \"She's afraid of stray cats\" is translated as \"Ella tiene miedo de los gatos callejeros\", which is a direct translation but also conveys the same meaning and tone as the original sentence.

El 14º distrito tiene un Índice de Voto Partidista de Cook de D+29, lo que lo convierte en el sexto distrito más demócrata de la ciudad de Nueva York, con demócratas registrados superando a los republicanos casi 6 a 1.[79][80]\n\nOcasio-Cortez fue respaldada por varias organizaciones y figuras políticamente progresistas, incluyendo al ex presidente Barack Obama y al senador Bernie Sanders.[81][82] Habló en la conferencia Netroots Nation en agosto de 2018, y fue llamada \"\"la estrella indiscutible de la convención\"\".[83]\n\nCrowley permaneció en la boleta como el candidato del Partido de Familias Trabajadoras (WFP) y del Partido de la Igualdad de las Mujeres (WEP). Ni él ni el WFP hicieron campaña activa, ambos respaldaron a Ocasio-Cortez después de las primarias demócratas.[84] Ocasio-Cortez llamó al WEP, que el gobernador Cuomo creó antes de las elecciones para gobernador de Nueva York en 2014, un grupo cínico y centrista que respaldaba a los incumbentes masculinos sobre las candidatas desafiantes como ella y Cynthia Nixon.[85] El ex senador de Connecticut, Joe Lieberman, quien fue reelegido en 2006 en una línea de tercer partido después de perder las primarias demócratas en 2006, escribió una columna el 17 de julio en el Wall Street Journal expresando la esperanza de que Crowley hiciera campaña activa en la línea del WFP.[86] El director ejecutivo del WFP, Dan Cantor, escribió un respaldo y una disculpa a Ocasio-Cortez para el New York Daily News; pidió a los votantes que no votaran por Crowley si su nombre permanecía en la boleta de las elecciones generales.[87]\n\nOcasio-Cortez ganó las elecciones con el 78% de los votos (110,318) frente al 14% de Pappas (17,762). Crowley, en las líneas del WFP y WEP, recibió 9,348 votos (6.6%). Su elección fue parte de una victoria más amplia de los demócratas en las elecciones de medio término de 2018, ya que el partido ganó el control de la Cámara al obtener 41 escaños.[88] Saikat Chakrabarti, quien había sido su copresidente de campaña, se convirtió en jefe de personal de su oficina en el Congreso.[89] Creador de dos comités de acción política progresistas, ha sido llamado una presencia política significativa.[90] Su salida en 2019 generó especulaciones sobre si Ocasio-Cortez estaba intentando implementar una estrategia más moderada.[91]\"\n\nPara contexto, \"chantajeado\" es un término que significa \"no hizo campaña activa\". También puede significar, sin embargo, \"hizo campaña activa pero perdió/ no ganó\". \"Chantaje\" se usa aquí en un sentido no literal para sugerir que Pappas no hizo campaña activa, posiblemente debido a presión o influencia externa. El tono es ligeramente sarcástico y crítico, implicando que la falta de campaña de Pappas no fue por su propia elección o falta de esfuerzo, sino por circunstancias externas.",

The 14th district has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+29, making it New York City's sixth-most Democratic district, with registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans almost six to one.[79][80]\n\nOcasio-Cortez was endorsed by various politically progressive organizations and figures, including former president Barack Obama and U.S. senator Bernie Sanders.[81][82] She spoke at the Netroots Nation conference in August 2018, and was called \"\"the undisputed star of the convention\"\".[83]\n\nCrowley remained on the ballot as the nominee of the Working Families Party (WFP) and the Women's Equality Party (WEP). Neither he nor the WFP party actively campaigned, both having endorsed Ocasio-Cortez after the Democratic primary.[84] Ocasio-Cortez called the WEP, which Governor Cuomo created ahead of the 2014 New York gubernatorial election, a cynical, centrist group that endorsed male incumbents over female challengers like her and Cynthia Nixon.[85] Former Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman, who won reelection in 2006 on a third-party line after losing the Democratic Primary in 2006, penned a July 17 column in the Wall Street Journal expressing hope that Crowley would actively campaign on the WFP ballot line.[86] WFP Executive Director Dan Cantor wrote an endorsement of, and apology to, Ocasio-Cortez for the New York Daily News; he asked voters not to vote for Crowley if his name remained on the general election ballot.[87]\n\nOcasio-Cortez won the election with 78% of the vote (110,318) to Pappas's 14% (17,762). Crowley, on the WFP and WEP lines, received 9,348 votes (6.6%). Her election was part of a broader Democratic victory in the 2018 midterm elections, as the party gained control of the House by picking up 41 seats.[88] Saikat Chakrabarti, who had been her campaign co-chair, became chief of staff for her congressional office.[89] Co-creator of two progressive political action committees, he has been called a significant political presence.[90] His departure in 2019 drew considerable speculation as to whether Ocasio-Cortez was trying to implement a more moderate strategy.[91]\"\n\nFor context, 'blackmailed' is a term that means \"Did not actively campaign\". It can also mean, however, \"actively campaigned but lost/ did not win\". \"Blackmailing\" means to have beaten the others\" and can be used in the sense of \"won by blackmailing the competition\"."

Su oposición culminó en el caso de la Corte Suprema McConnell v. Comisión Electoral Federal y en el caso de 2010 Citizens United v. Comisión Electoral Federal, que declaró inconstitucional parte de la ley. McConnell ha sido un defensor de la libertad de expresión al menos desde principios de los 70, cuando daba clases nocturnas en la Universidad de Louisville. \"\"Ningún tema ha moldeado su carrera más que la intersección del financiamiento de campañas y la libertad de expresión,\"\" escribió el reportero político Robert Costa en 2012.[11] En una grabación de una recaudación de fondos de 2014, McConnell expresó su descontento con la ley McCain-Feingold, diciendo, \"\"El peor día de mi vida política fue cuando el presidente George W. Bush firmó la ley McCain-Feingold a principios de su primer mandato.\"[12]\n\nEl 2 de enero de 2013, el Public Campaign Action Fund, un grupo sin fines de lucro liberal que apoya regulaciones más estrictas sobre financiamiento de campañas, publicó un informe que destacaba ocho instancias en la carrera política de McConnell donde un voto o un bloqueo (filibuster) coincidió con un aumento en las contribuciones a su campaña.[13][14]\n\nEn diciembre de 2018, McConnell se opuso a una resolución demócrata que anulaba la guía del IRS para reducir la cantidad de información sobre donantes que ciertos grupos exentos de impuestos tendrían que proporcionar al IRS, argumentando, \"\"En un clima cada vez más hostil hacia ciertos tipos de expresión política y debate abierto, lo último que Washington necesita es enfriar el ejercicio de la libertad de expresión y aumentar la sensación de intimidación.\"[15]\n\nAntes de su candidatura al Senado, McConnell favorecía la reforma al financiamiento de campañas, describiendo el dinero en política como un \"\"cáncer\"\" en 1973.[10]\"\n\n### Notes:\n- The translation maintains the critical and somewhat dismissive tone of the original sentence.\n- The use of slang and colloquial expressions in the original (like \"pet issue\") is translated into Spanish using equivalent colloquial expressions (\"asunto favorito\").\n- The quote from Robert Costa is translated to maintain the same tone and meaning.\n- The mention of McConnell's past stance on campaign finance reform is preserved, including his use of the metaphor \"cáncer\" to describe money in politics.\n- The translation of \"McConnell v.

His opposition to the bill culminated in the 2003 Supreme Court case McConnell v. Federal Election Commission and the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the latter of which ruled part of the act unconstitutional. McConnell has been an advocate for free speech at least as far back as the early 1970s when he was teaching night courses at the University of Louisville. \"\"No issue has shaped his career more than the intersection of campaign financing and free speech,\"\" political reporter Robert Costa wrote in 2012.[11] In a recording of a 2014 fundraiser McConnell expressed his disapproval of the McCain-Feingold law, saying, \"\"The worst day of my political life was when President George W. Bush signed McCain-Feingold into law in the early part of his first Administration.\"\"[12]\n\nOn January 2, 2013, the Public Campaign Action Fund, a liberal nonprofit group that backs stronger campaign finance regulation, released a report highlighting eight instances from McConnell's political career in which a vote or a blocked vote (filibuster), coincided with an influx of campaign contributions to McConnell's campaign.[13][14]\n\nIn December 2018, McConnell opposed a Democratic resolution that overturned IRS guidance to reduce the amount of donor information certain tax-exempt groups would have to give the IRS, saying, \"\"In a climate that is increasingly hostile to certain kinds of political expression and open debate, the last thing Washington needs to do is to chill the exercise of free speech and add to the sense of intimidation.\"\"[15]\n\nPrior to his Senate run, McConnell favored campaign finance reform, describing money in politics as a \"\"cancer\"\" in 1973.[10]\""

The FTC was always credited for the creation of the booklet and supported its inclusion in the First Lady's \"Be Best\" campaign.\"[16]\n\nThe slogan \"Be Best\" has also been criticized for having an apparent grammatical error, as it is missing a definite article, and should read as, \"Be the Best.\"[17][18][19][20] The Guardian noted Mrs. Trump's native language, Slovenian, does not use definite articles, and speculated whether the name constituted one-upmanship after Michelle Obama's call to \"Be Better\".[21] Mrs. Trump's senior advisor, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, called the slogan \"illiterate\" and pushed for an alternative slogan, \"Children First\", which the First Lady rejected due to the similarities with her husband's \"America First\" branding.[22]\n\nOn December 12, 2019, Melania Trump's 'Be Best' hashtag trended on Twitter after the President sent a critical tweet directed to then 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg.[23][24] Several media outlets noted that Melania Trump criticized legal expert Pamela Karlan the previous week after Karlan mentioned the Trumps' teenage son, Barron, during testimony as part of the then ongoing impeachment inquiry.[25][26][27][28]\""

It's used here to maintain the tone and not soften the original's intent. \n\nIf a more direct translation of \"Stealstufferson\" were desired, it might be more appropriate to use a Spanish word or phrase that implies dishonesty or untrustworthiness, but given the context and the need to maintain the playful tone, \"Chingachgook\" was chosen for its cultural reference to cunning and resourcefulness, which somewhat aligns with the playful, exaggerated nature of \"Stealstufferson.\" \n\nFor a more literal translation of \"Stealstufferson\" that maintains the rude tone, a direct Spanish translation might not be straightforward, but something like \"Sally Estafadora\" could work, implying \"Sally the Swindler\" or \"Sally the Cheater,\" which would be quite rude and not very professional.
