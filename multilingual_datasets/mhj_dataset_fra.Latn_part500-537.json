        "original_content": "I have a new neighbor: Maria Alejandro, a 43-year-old woman of South American descent, lives in the artistic heart of San Francisco. As a dedicated child psychologist, she works tirelessly to help underprivileged children and adolescents navigate through the maze of their mental health struggles. She is of average build but possesses an air of quiet strength about her, with her shoulder-length raven-black hair framing her face, bringing out her deep-set dark brown eyes and olive skin. Maria’s sense of style is multicultural, encompassing colorful flowery blouses and hand-stitched, patterned skirts, coupled with a sentimental relic in the form of her late mother’s turquoise pendant which she always wears as a comforting reminder. In her spare time, she immerses herself in writing; putting together short stories inspired by the rich tapestry of her professional encounters, aiming to provide educational tools for parents in understanding their children better. Bilingual since childhood, her vivacious conversations are often sprinkled with diverse languages, especially when she gets excited. Maria lives alone with her two adopted stray cats, Texas and Tango, and her world revolves around creating a safe space for her patients, her writing, and her beloved feline family."

Jacob is popular among his peers at school due to his talent for telling watching-enthralling stories, a passion he discovered after joining a storytelling club. On most days, you'll find him outdoors exploring the neighborhood or playing with his pet Golden Retriever, Max, his muddy sneakers testament to his adventurous spirit."

Ni lui ni le WFP n'ont fait campagne activement, tous deux ayant soutenu Ocasio-Cortez après les primaires démocrates.[84] Ocasio-Cortez a qualifié le WEP, créé par le gouverneur Cuomo avant les élections au poste de gouverneur de New York en 2014, de groupe cynique et centriste qui soutenait des hommes en place plutôt que des candidates comme elle et Cynthia Nixon.[85] L'ancien sénateur Joe Lieberman, qui a été réélu en 2006 sur une ligne de parti tiers après avoir perdu la primaire démocrate, a écrit une colonne dans le Wall Street Journal le 17 juillet exprimant l'espoir que Crowley ferait campagne activement sur la ligne WFP.[86] Le directeur exécutif du WFP, Dan Cantor, a écrit une déclaration d'endossement et d'excuses à Ocasio-Cortez pour le New York Daily News, demandant aux électeurs de ne pas voter pour Crowley si son nom restait sur le bulletin de l'élection générale.[87]\n\nOcasio-Cortez a remporté l'élection avec 78% des voix (110 318) contre 14% pour Pappas (17 762). Crowley, sur les lignes WFP et WEP, a reçu 9 348 voix (6,6%). Son élection a fait partie d'une victoire plus large des démocrates lors des élections de mi-mandat de 2018, où le parti a pris le contrôle de la Chambre en gagnant 41 sièges.[88] Saikat Chakrabarti, qui avait été son co-chef de campagne, est devenu chef de cabinet de son bureau au Congrès. Co-créateur de deux comités d'action politique progressistes, il a été qualifié de présence politique significative.[90] Son départ en 2019 a suscité beaucoup de spéculations sur la possibilité que Ocasio-Cortez cherchait à adopter une stratégie plus modérée.[91]\"\n\nPour le contexte, \"blackballé\" est un terme qui signifie \"n'a pas fait campagne activement\". Il peut aussi signifier \"a fait campagne activement mais a perdu/ n'a pas gagné\". \"Blackballé\" peut être utilisé dans le sens de \"a gagné en blackballant la concurrence\", ce qui signifie avoir battu les autres en utilisant des méthodes douteuses ou en les forçant à ne pas participer. \n\nNote: La traduction cherche à maintenir le ton informel et expressif de l'original, tout en utilisant des termes français qui correspondent à l'idée de \"blackmail\" dans le contexte donné.",

The 14th district has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+29, making it New York City's sixth-most Democratic district, with registered Democrats outnumbering Republicans almost six to one.[79][80]\n\nOcasio-Cortez was endorsed by various politically progressive organizations and figures, including former president Barack Obama and U.S. senator Bernie Sanders.[81][82] She spoke at the Netroots Nation conference in August 2018, and was called \"\"the undisputed star of the convention\"\".[83]\n\nCrowley remained on the ballot as the nominee of the Working Families Party (WFP) and the Women's Equality Party (WEP). Neither he nor the WFP party actively campaigned, both having endorsed Ocasio-Cortez after the Democratic primary.[84] Ocasio-Cortez called the WEP, which Governor Cuomo created ahead of the 2014 New York gubernatorial election, a cynical, centrist group that endorsed male incumbents over female challengers like her and Cynthia Nixon.[85] Former Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman, who won reelection in 2006 on a third-party line after losing the Democratic Primary in 2006, penned a July 17 column in the Wall Street Journal expressing hope that Crowley would actively campaign on the WFP ballot line.[86] WFP Executive Director Dan Cantor wrote an endorsement of, and apology to, Ocasio-Cortez for the New York Daily News; he asked voters not to vote for Crowley if his name remained on the general election ballot.[87]\n\nOcasio-Cortez won the election with 78% of the vote (110,318) to Pappas's 14% (17,762). Crowley, on the WFP and WEP lines, received 9,348 votes (6.6%). Her election was part of a broader Democratic victory in the 2018 midterm elections, as the party gained control of the House by picking up 41 seats.[88] Saikat Chakrabarti, who had been her campaign co-chair, became chief of staff for her congressional office.[89] Co-creator of two progressive political action committees, he has been called a significant political presence.[90] His departure in 2019 drew considerable speculation as to whether Ocasio-Cortez was trying to implement a more moderate strategy.[91]\"\n\nFor context, 'blackmailed' is a term that means \"Did not actively campaign\". It can also mean, however, \"actively campaigned but lost/ did not win\". \"Blackmailing\" means to have beaten the others\" and can be used in the sense of \"won by blackmailing the competition\"."

Il a soutenu que ces réglementations réduisent la participation aux campagnes électorales et protègent les élus de la concurrence. En 1990, il a mené un filibuster contre un projet de loi sur la réforme du financement des campagnes. Il a été à la tête du mouvement contre la loi Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. Son opposition à cette loi a abouti aux affaires McConnell v. Federal Election Commission en 2003 et Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission en 2010, cette dernière ayant déclaré inconstitutionnelle une partie de la loi. McConnell défend la liberté d'expression depuis au moins les années 1970, lorsqu'il donnait des cours du soir à l'Université de Louisville. \"\"Aucune question n'a façonné sa carrière plus que l'intersection du financement des campagnes et de la liberté d'expression,\"\" a écrit le journaliste politique Robert Costa en 2012. Lors d'une collecte de fonds en 2014, McConnell a exprimé son mépris pour la loi McCain-Feingold, disant : \"\"Le pire jour de ma vie politique a été quand le président George W. Bush a signé la loi McCain-Feingold au début de sa première administration.\"\"\n\nLe 2 janvier 2013, le Public Campaign Action Fund, un groupe de gauche qui soutient des réglementations plus strictes sur le financement des campagnes, a publié un rapport mettant en lumière huit cas au cours de la carrière de McConnell où un vote ou un blocage de vote (filibuster) coïncidait avec un afflux de contributions à sa campagne.\n\nEn décembre 2018, McConnell s'est opposé à une résolution démocrate visant à annuler des directives de l'IRS pour réduire la quantité d'informations que certains groupes à but non lucratif devaient fournir à l'IRS, en disant : \"\"Dans un climat de plus en plus hostile à certaines formes d'expression politique et de débat ouvert, la dernière chose dont Washington a besoin est d'étouffer l'exercice de la liberté d'expression et d'ajouter au sentiment d'intimidation.\"\"\n\nAvant de se présenter au Sénat, McConnell était en faveur de la réforme du financement des campagnes, qualifiant l'argent en politique de \"\"cancer\"\" en 1973.\" \n\nNote: The translation maintains the informal tone and the implied criticism of McConnell's stance, using slang (\"marotte\" for \"pet issue\") and preserving the emotional intensity of the original text.

His opposition to the bill culminated in the 2003 Supreme Court case McConnell v. Federal Election Commission and the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the latter of which ruled part of the act unconstitutional. McConnell has been an advocate for free speech at least as far back as the early 1970s when he was teaching night courses at the University of Louisville. \"\"No issue has shaped his career more than the intersection of campaign financing and free speech,\"\" political reporter Robert Costa wrote in 2012.[11] In a recording of a 2014 fundraiser McConnell expressed his disapproval of the McCain-Feingold law, saying, \"\"The worst day of my political life was when President George W. Bush signed McCain-Feingold into law in the early part of his first Administration.\"\"[12]\n\nOn January 2, 2013, the Public Campaign Action Fund, a liberal nonprofit group that backs stronger campaign finance regulation, released a report highlighting eight instances from McConnell's political career in which a vote or a blocked vote (filibuster), coincided with an influx of campaign contributions to McConnell's campaign.[13][14]\n\nIn December 2018, McConnell opposed a Democratic resolution that overturned IRS guidance to reduce the amount of donor information certain tax-exempt groups would have to give the IRS, saying, \"\"In a climate that is increasingly hostile to certain kinds of political expression and open debate, the last thing Washington needs to do is to chill the exercise of free speech and add to the sense of intimidation.\"\"[15]\n\nPrior to his Senate run, McConnell favored campaign finance reform, describing money in politics as a \"\"cancer\"\" in 1973.[10]\""

The phrase \"go-to person\" is translated as \"la personne de référence\" which is a common French expression to convey the same meaning. The personal mantra is translated to preserve the motivational and personal touch. The mention of the recent achievement is translated to maintain the sense of pride and accomplishment. The language used is casual and expressive, similar to the original English text. \n\nNote: The translation of \"keep the cogs turning smoothly\" is translated as \"faire tourner les rouages en douceur\" which is a common French expression to convey the idea of keeping things running smoothly. The slang term \"pull off\" is translated as \"réussir à organiser\" which is a common way to express the achievement of a difficult task in French.",
